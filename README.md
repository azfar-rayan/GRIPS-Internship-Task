## Prediction using Supervised ML (SLE)


In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves two variables , student study hours and student percentage.

The dataset used is a *student_info.csv* file which contains sample hours that a student has studied and the percentage marks they achieved.
